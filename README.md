## About

Independent consultant specializing in biomarker validation and clinical trial design for neurodegenerative disease, metabolic disease, and digital health programs. I focus on preventing costly failures by identifying confounding vulnerabilities and methodological flaws before trials enroll or studies publish.

**15+ years:** Multi-omic integration, translational neuroscience, clinical trial and observational study design, deep expertise in longitudinal studies

**Former:** Senior Research Scientist, Institute for Systems Biology (ISB; worked with Lee Hood and Mary Brunkow); Assistant Professor, University of Houston

**Editor:** Academia Neuroscience & Brain Research  

**Track record:** 65+ publications, $5M+ grant funding, $1.5M industry revenue

**Current focus:** Independent methodology validation | Biomarker platform assessment | Trial design audits | Investor due diligence | Translational program development

## Recent Work

### 📊 Nature Medicine ALS Biomarker Reanalysis (2025)

Independent methodological investigation revealing severe confounding in high-profile proteomics study:
- **72%** of published biomarkers failed geographic validation
- **99.9%** accuracy predicting technical artifacts (tube type) vs. disease
- **$15M+** estimated preventable follow-up costs

**Key finding:** Perfect confounding between diagnostic groups and technical factors created models learning artifacts instead of biology. Standard validation (98% pooled CV accuracy) missed this; geographic validation revealed deployment failure (77% AUC cross-site).
