### About Me

Translational scientist with 10+ years of experience bridging computational approaches with deep biological understanding to accelerate therapeutic development. I specialize in:

- Integrating multi-modal and multi-omic data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics)
- Developing and validating biomarkers for neurological conditions
- Applying advanced computational methods to complex biological problems
- Designing and implementing translational strategies for drug development

Currently focused on neurodegenerative diseases (ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's/LBD, MS) with extensive experience leading cross-functional teams through innovative projects in collaboration with industry partners.
